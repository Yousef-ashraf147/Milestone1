          <i>1.1 Pricing</i>
        </h3>
        The prices of content on Udemy are determined based on the terms of the
        Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some instances, the price
        of content offered on the Udemy website may not be exactly the same as
        the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due to mobile
        platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies around
        implementing sales and promotions. We occasionally run promotions and
        sales for our content, during which certain content is available at
        discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the
        content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the
        content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may also
        be different when you are logged into your account from the price
        available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of
        our promotions are available only to new users. If you are logged into
        your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location when
        you created your account. If you are not logged into your account, the
        price currency is based on the country where you are located. We do not
        enable users to see pricing in other currencies. If you are a student
        located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or
        value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for
        collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities.
        Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or
        tax may be added at checkout.

        <h2>
          <b>1.2 Payments </b>
        </h2>
        You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you
        authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other means
        of payment (such as Boleto, SEPA, direct debit, or mobile wallet) for
        those fees. Udemy works with payment service providers to offer you the
        most convenient payment methods in your country and to keep your payment
        information secure. We may update your payment methods using information
        provided by our payment service providers. Check out our Privacy Policy
        for more details. When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an
        invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and
        you still get access to the content you are enrolling in, you agree to
        pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (30) days of notification
        from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any content for which
        we have not received adequate payment.

        <h2>
          <b>1.3 Refunds and Refund Credits</b>
        </h2>
        If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can
        request, within 30 days of your purchase of the content, that Udemy
        apply a refund to your account. This refund option does not apply to
        Subscription Plan purchases, which are covered in Section 8.4 below. We
        reserve the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to
        your original payment method, at our discretion, depending on
        capabilities of our payment service providers, the platform from which
        you purchased your content (website, mobile or TV app), and other
        factors. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day
        guarantee time limit has passed. However, if the content you previously
        purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a
        refund beyond this 30-day limit. Udemy also reserves the right to refund
        students beyond the 30-day limit in cases of suspected or confirmed
        account fraud. To request a refund, follow the steps here. As detailed
        in the Instructor Terms, instructors agree that students have the right
        to receive these refunds. If we decide to issue refund credits to your
        account, they will be automatically applied towards your next content
        purchase on our website, but can’t be used for purchases in our mobile
        or TV applications. Refund credits may expire if not used within the
        specified period and have no cash value, in each case unless otherwise
        required by applicable law. At our discretion, if we believe you are
        abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a significant
        portion of the content that you want to refund or if you’ve previously
        refunded the content, we reserve the right to deny your refund, restrict
        you from other future refunds, ban your account, and/or restrict all
        future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable your
        access to the content due to your violation of these Terms or our Trust
        & Safety Guidelines, you will not be eligible to receive a refund.
        Additional information on our refund policy is available here.
